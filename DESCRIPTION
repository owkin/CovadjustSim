Description: A study of the effect of covariate adjustment in clinical trials,
    based on parametric and semi-synthetic simulations. This package is intended
    to reproduce the results presented in the article "More efficient and
    inclusive time-to-event trials with covariate adjustment: a simulation
    study".
