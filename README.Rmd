# CovadjustSim

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CovadjustSim is to ensure the reproducibility of the results
presented in the paper "More efficient and inclusive time-to-event trials with
covariate adjustment: a simulation study".

Additionally, it may also be useful for power analysis for models based on the
proportional hazard assumption.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CovadjustSim from
[GitHub](https://github.com/owkin/CovadjustSim) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("owkin/CovadjustSim")
```

## Simulation results

All simulation results are summarised in vignettes:

``` r
vignettes("power", package = "CovadjustSim")
vignettes("eligibility", package = "CovadjustSim")
```

Steps to reproduce the results of parametric simulations are available in the
source codes under the folder `data-raw`.

## Power analysis with simulations

TBD
